# UniExchange

A campus marketplace platform for buying, selling, and exchanging goods and services within the university community. Built as a group project by students of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT).

Unlike Facebook Marketplace or Gumtree, UniExchange is closed to the public: only someone who can prove they hold a `@mycput.ac.za` mailbox can create an account, which is what keeps listings campus-relevant and cuts down on scams.

**Current status:** the backend is fully layered with Spring Security + JWT, and verified-student authentication (signup → email OTP → login) works end to end, with the emailed code acting as a second factor at sign-in and a "Remember me" trusted-device option. The frontend implements those screens, and all remaining pages are scaffolded and routed with an owner assigned to each — the team is filling them in now.

### Frontend

| Component      | Choice                                                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Framework      | React 19.2                                                    |

| HTTP           | native `fetch`, wrapped in `src/lib/api/`                      |
| Linting        | ESLint 10 (flat config) + typescript-eslint                   |

No component library and no HTTP client dependency — the API surface is small enough that `fetch` behind one client is enough. `lib/api/` is split one module per feature so team members do not collide in a single file.

## Project Structure

```

├── Frontend/    → React + TypeScript client (runs on :5173)
└── README.md    → this file
```

## Prerequisites

Four things need to be installed. Check each before starting.

### 1. A JDK, version 25 or newer

The project compiles with `--release 25`, so **JDK 25 is the minimum**. JDK 26 also works.

```bash
java -version          # e.g. openjdk version "25.0.2"
echo $JAVA_HOME        # macOS/Linux
echo %JAVA_HOME%       # Windows cmd
```

**Maven uses `JAVA_HOME`, not whatever `java` is on your `PATH`** — if those two disagree, the build follows `JAVA_HOME`. If you have several JDKs installed:

```bash
# macOS - list every installed JDK
/usr/libexec/java_home -V

# macOS/Linux - point this shell at JDK 25
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 25)

# Windows PowerShell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-25"
```

If `java -version` reports 24 or lower, install JDK 25+ from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) or [jdk.java.net](https://jdk.java.net/) first. Otherwise the build fails with `invalid target release: 25`.

### 2. Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+

Required by Vite 8. Node 24 LTS is a safe choice.

```bash
node -v    # must be >= 20.19, or >= 22.12
npm -v
```

Get it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 3. MySQL server, version 8 or newer

**The backend will not start without it.** H2 is only on the test classpath, so it covers the test suite but cannot run the app.

```bash
mysql --version
```

If that command isn't found, install MySQL Community Server from [dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) — note the macOS installer puts it in `/usr/local/mysql/bin`, which is not on your `PATH` by default — or via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install mysql && brew services start mysql
```

MySQL Workbench is optional, but handy for inspecting the schema.

### 4. Maven — already included

Do **not** install Maven. Use the wrapper in `Backend/`. On macOS/Linux, make it executable once after cloning:

```bash
chmod +x Backend/mvnw
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and branch

`main` is protected by team convention — never commit to it directly.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd UniExchange
git checkout -b MYK-240453182     # your own initials-studentNumber
```

### 2. Set up MySQL

Make sure the server is running, then create the database. The app creates the **tables** itself (`ddl-auto=update`), but not the database.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

> **`zsh: command not found: mysql`?** The official macOS installer does not add
> MySQL to your `PATH`. Add it:
>
> ```bash
> export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"     # add to ~/.zshrc to keep it
> ```
>
> The **server** can be running perfectly well even when the `mysql` client is
> missing from `PATH` — check with `pgrep -fl mysqld`, or use MySQL Workbench, or
> System Settings → MySQL. Homebrew installs land in `/opt/homebrew/bin` instead
> and are already on `PATH`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS uniexchange
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

The connection URL also passes `createDatabaseIfNotExist=true`, so this is belt-and-braces — but doing it explicitly makes failures easier to diagnose.

### 3. Configure your database password

**Do not type your password into `application.properties`.** That file is committed to git, so a password there gets shared with the whole team and pushed to GitHub. It reads from environment variables instead:

```properties
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USERNAME:root}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD:}
```

Pick whichever option suits how you run the app.

**Option A — environment variable** (works from the terminal):

```bash
# macOS/Linux; add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to make it permanent
export DB_PASSWORD='your-mysql-password'

# Windows PowerShell
$env:DB_PASSWORD = "your-mysql-password"
```

**Option B — an untracked properties file** (easier in IntelliJ / VS Code, since you don't have to configure env vars in the run profile). Create `Backend/src/main/resources/application-local.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.password=your-mysql-password
```

`application.properties` sets `spring.profiles.active=${SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE:local}`,
so this file is picked up automatically — no extra flags. A deployment sets
`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`, which replaces `local` entirely, so production never
loads a developer's local profile. When it does not exist, Spring simply
ignores it, so teammates who never create one are unaffected. The filename is
already in `.gitignore`, so it can never be committed.

This is also where SMTP credentials go — see
[Email / OTP Delivery](#email--otp-delivery).

> Why a profile file and not `spring.config.import`? Imported config has *lower*
> precedence than the file importing it, so an imported override is silently
> ignored. A profile-specific file overrides the base file, which is what we need.

> If your MySQL `root` account has no password, skip this step — the default is empty.

### 3b. Seed the campuses and categories

Hibernate creates the tables but never puts rows in them, so on a fresh database
the **Create listing** form has empty Campus and Category dropdowns and cannot be
submitted — which makes the whole marketplace look broken when it is only
unseeded. Run this once:

```bash
cd Backend
mysql -u root -p uniexchange < src/main/resources/db/seed-reference-data.sql
```

It adds the five CPUT campuses and nine listing categories, and is safe to run
again — every statement does nothing if the row is already there.

### 4. Run the backend

```bash
cd Backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run          # Windows: .\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

> **In VS Code you can skip steps 4 and 5** — press `F5` with
> "Full Stack: Backend + Frontend" selected and both start together.
> See [Running in VS Code](#running-in-vs-code).

The first run downloads dependencies, so it needs internet and takes a minute. You should see `Started UniExchangeApplication`, 22 `create table` statements on a fresh database, and:

```
No spring.mail.host configured - verification emails will be logged, not sent.
```

That warning is expected and intentional — see [Email / OTP Delivery](#email--otp-delivery).

The API is now on **http://localhost:8080**. Quick check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/listings     # -> []  (a public endpoint)
```

### 5. Run the frontend

In a **second terminal**:

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install                 # first time only
cp .env.example .env.local  # Windows: copy .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**.

`.env.local` only needs editing if your backend is not on port 8080:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

No dev proxy is configured or needed — the backend already allows `http://localhost:5173` as a CORS origin.

### 6. Try it

1. Go to http://localhost:5173 → you are redirected to `/login`.
2. Click **Create an account** and sign up with a real student email such as `240453182@mycput.ac.za`. Anything else is rejected.
3. You land on the code screen. **The code is in the backend terminal**, in a box like this:

   ```
   ======================= EMAIL (NOT SENT) =======================
   To      : 240453182@mycput.ac.za
   Subject : Your UniExchange verification code
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Your UniExchange verification code is:

       429183
   ```

4. Type or paste those 6 digits → you are signed in and land on the feed.

## Running in VS Code

The repo ships run/debug profiles, so once the prerequisites and your DB password
are set up you do **not** need two terminals.

1. Install the recommended extensions — VS Code prompts you when you open the
   repo, or run **"Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions"**. The important one
   is the **Extension Pack for Java**.
2. Open the **Run and Debug** panel (the play-with-bug icon, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D`).
3. Choose **"Full Stack: Backend + Frontend"** and press the green play button (or `F5`).

That starts the API on :8080 and the Vite dev server on :5173, then opens Chrome
attached to the debugger. Breakpoints work in Java and in the Vite process, and
the site opens in your normal browser. Stopping one stops both.

React `.tsx` breakpoints inside VS Code are deliberately **not** wired into the
F5 profile. Attaching VS Code's JavaScript debugger makes Chrome open a blank
page first and then navigate to the app, which leaves `about:blank` in the
browser history — so the first press of the back button after signing in lands
on a blank page. Use Chrome DevTools, which is unaffected, or run
`Frontend: Chrome (debugger)` by hand when you specifically want VS Code
breakpoints in React.

The individual profiles are also there if you only want one half:

| Profile | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Full Stack: Backend + Frontend` | Both at once — the usual choice |
| `Full Stack + PayFast tunnel` | The same, plus a cloudflared tunnel so PayFast sandbox top-ups actually complete. Needs cloudflared — see [Payments (PayFast)](#payments-payfast) |
| `Backend: Spring Boot` | API only, with Java breakpoints |
| `Frontend: Vite dev server` | Dev server only; opens the site in your browser |
| `Frontend: Chrome (debugger)` | Optional. React breakpoints in VS Code, at the cost of the `about:blank` history entry. Start the dev server first |

### Tasks

**"Tasks: Run Task"** (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`) gives you:

| Task | What it does |
|---|---|
| `frontend: install` | `npm install` — run once after cloning |
| `frontend: dev server` / `build` / `lint` | The npm scripts |
| `backend: test` / `backend: build` | Maven, via the wrapper |
| `payfast: tunnel` | cloudflared quick tunnel to `localhost:8080`, started automatically by the PayFast F5 profile |
| **`full stack: verify`** | Backend tests → frontend lint → frontend build. **Run this before opening a PR.** |

> The Vite profile sets `NO_COLOR=1`. Vite otherwise embeds ANSI colour codes
> inside its printed URL, which breaks the auto-attach pattern match. The
> banner is monochrome; Chrome attaching reliably is worth it.

> `.vscode/launch.json`, `tasks.json`, `extensions.json` and `settings.json` are
> committed so the whole team gets them. `settings.json` deliberately contains no
> JDK path — the Java extension auto-detects, and an absolute path would be wrong
> on everyone else's machine.

## Configuration Reference

### Files you may need to edit

| File | When | Committed? |
|---|---|---|
| `Frontend/.env.local` | Backend on a non-default port | No (gitignored) |
| `Backend/src/main/resources/application-local.properties` | **Your DB password, SMTP credentials and PayFast tunnel settings** — everything personal or secret | No (gitignored) |
| `Backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` | Changing a setting **for the whole team** | **Yes — never put secrets here** |
| `Backend/src/test/resources/application.properties` | Test-only config (H2) | Yes |

### Backend properties worth knowing

In `Backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

| Property | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `spring.datasource.url` | `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/uniexchange` | `DB_NAME` overrides the database name |
| `spring.datasource.username` | `${DB_USERNAME:root}` | |
| `spring.datasource.password` | `${DB_PASSWORD:}` | Never hardcode |
| `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` | `update` | Hibernate creates/updates tables on boot. `validate` under the `prod` profile |
| `app.jwt.secret` | `${JWT_SECRET:}` | **No default** — set `JWT_SECRET` (or put it in `application-local.properties`). **Must be ≥ 32 bytes** or startup fails |
| `app.jwt.ttl-seconds` | `3600` | One hour; there is no refresh endpoint |
| `app.jwt.remembered-ttl-seconds` | `604800` | 7 days, for a "Remember me" sign-in. A JWT cannot be revoked, so this is kept to a week |
| `app.trusted-device.remembered-days` | `30` | How long a remembered browser may skip the OTP. Slides forward on each use |
| `app.trusted-device.session-hours` | `12` | The same, when "Remember me" was **not** ticked. A hard cap |
| `app.auth.student-email-pattern` | `^\d{8,10}@mycput\.ac\.za$` | The signup gate |
| `app.otp.length` | `6` | |
| `app.otp.ttl-minutes` | `10` | |
| `app.otp.max-attempts` | `5` | After this the code is dead |
| `app.otp.resend-cooldown-seconds` | `60` | Applies to `/resend-otp` and to the code `/login` sends |
| `app.otp.max-per-day` | `10` | Codes emailed to one account per rolling 24 hours (protects the Gmail quota) |
| `app.cors.allowed-origins` | `${CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS:http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000}` | Set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the deployed frontend origin. Never `*` |
| `app.wallet.max-topup` / `max-transfer` | `5000.00` | Rand cap per top-up / per transfer |
| `app.wallet.daily-limit` | `10000.00` | Most a student may top up, and separately send, in any rolling 24 hours |
| `app.uploads.max-bytes` / `daily-quota-bytes` | `10485760` / `104857600` | 10 MB per image, 100 MB per student per rolling day |
| `app.rate-limit.enabled` | `true` | Per-IP/per-user request limits (`security/RateLimitFilter`); tests switch it off |
| `app.payfast.merchant-id` / `merchant-key` / `passphrase` | sandbox values | `PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID`, `PAYFAST_MERCHANT_KEY`, `PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE` override them |

Do not set `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect` — Hibernate 7 auto-detects it, and `MySQL8Dialect` no longer exists (only `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect`).

### Production profile and schema

`application-prod.properties` is loaded when `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`. It sets
`ddl-auto=validate`, hides exception messages and stack traces from error bodies,
turns off SQL logging and the PayFast simulator, and trusts Azure's proxy headers
(`server.forward-headers-strategy=native`).

Because production never lets Hibernate alter the schema, **a new table must exist
before the build that needs it is deployed**, or startup fails. Currently that is
`uploaded_file` (who uploaded each `/uploads/...` file):

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p <database> < Backend/src/main/resources/db/uploaded-file-table.sql
```

On a **brand-new, empty** production database there is no full schema script, so
`validate` has nothing to check against and startup fails. For the very first
deploy only, add the App Setting `SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update`, let the app
start once so Hibernate creates the tables, then **delete that setting** and restart.

### Deploying (Azure App Service + Vercel)

See [Deployment (Azure + Vercel)](#deployment-azure--vercel) for the full step-by-step guide, the current deployment and how to test it.

### SQL injection

Every query is a Spring Data derived query or a JPQL `@Query` with bound
`:parameters`; there is no native SQL built from strings anywhere in the app. Keep
it that way — never concatenate request values into a query string.

### Frontend environment

`Frontend/.env.local`, copied from `.env.example`:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Where the API lives |
| `VITE_STUDENT_EMAIL_PATTERN` | `^\d{8,10}@mycput\.ac\.za$` | Mirrors the backend rule, for instant form feedback |
| `VITE_SITE_URL` | *(empty: the serving origin)* | Public origin for canonical URLs, `og:image`, and the build-time `sitemap.xml` / `robots.txt` / `llms.txt`. **Set it for production builds** |

## Deployment (Azure + Vercel)

The backend runs on **Azure App Service**, the database on **Azure Database for
MySQL**, and the frontend on **Vercel**. Everything fits in the free tiers of an
**Azure for Students** subscription and **Vercel Hobby**. No code changes are needed
to deploy: the `prod` profile and `Frontend/vercel.json` already handle it, and
everything else is environment variables.

This is the full walkthrough, in the order it has to happen. Each part depends on
the one before it.

### The current deployment

| | |
|---|---|
| Frontend (Vercel, on Josh's account, deploys from `JoshBlack25/UniExchange` `main`) | https://uniexchange-rust.vercel.app |
| Backend (App Service `uniexchange-api`, plan `uniexchange-plan`, **F1 Free**, Linux, Java 25) | https://uniexchange-api-erbwhnbeg4fpdydv.southafricanorth-01.azurewebsites.net |
| Database (MySQL Flexible Server `uniexchange-db`, **B1ms**, MySQL 8.4) | `uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com`, database `uniexchange`, admin `uniadmin` |
| Resource group / region | `uniexchange-rg` / South Africa North |

Passwords and secrets are only in Azure's App Settings, never in this file.

### Staying free

- **Azure for Students has no credit card attached.** Anything that costs money
  comes out of the $100 credit, and when that runs out Azure stops the services.
  It cannot bill you. Still, pick the free settings below so the credit is not
  used up.
- **App Service: Free F1.** 60 CPU-minutes a day and 1 GB RAM. There is no
  "Always On", so the app sleeps after about 20 idle minutes and **the first
  request afterwards takes 30–60 seconds** while Spring Boot starts. The chat page
  polls every 3 seconds, so heavy use can use up the daily CPU quota, and Azure
  then stops the app until the next day.
- **MySQL: Burstable B1ms, 20 GB, no HA, no geo backup.** Free for 12 months on
  Azure for Students. Any other size bills the credit.
- **Never enable Application Insights.** It is billed separately.
- Optional safety net: **Cost Management → Budgets → Add**, amount $1, with an
  email alert.
- **Vercel Hobby** is free.

### Part 0 — Account and tools (once per machine)

1. **Azure for Students account.** Go to https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students
   → **Start free** → sign in with your `@mycput.ac.za` address and CPUT password
   (it is already a Microsoft account). Verify you are a student if asked (the code
   goes to your mycput inbox; check Junk). In the portal, **Subscriptions** should
   list **Azure for Students** as **Active**.
2. **Azure CLI:**
   ```bash
   brew install azure-cli
   az login          # browser opens; sign in with the mycput account
   ```
   When it lists tenants and subscriptions, press **Enter** to keep the default
   (*Cape Peninsula University of Technology* / *Azure for Students*). Check it:
   ```bash
   az account show --output table      # Name should be "Azure for Students"
   ```
3. **MySQL client on your `PATH`.** The macOS installer does not add it:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   mysql --version
   ```
4. **JDK 25 or newer** to build the jar (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).
5. **Region:** use one region for everything. We use **South Africa North**. If
   your subscription does not allow it, the create screen says so; try North Europe.

### Part 1 — Create the MySQL database

1. Portal → search **Azure Database for MySQL flexible servers** → **+ Create** →
   **Advanced create** if asked.
2. **Basics:**
   - Resource group: **Create new** → `uniexchange-rg`
   - Server name: `uniexchange-db`
   - Region: South Africa North
   - MySQL version: 8.0 or 8.4
   - Workload type: **For development or hobby projects**
   - **Configure server:** Burstable, **Standard_B1ms**, storage **20 GiB**,
     Pre-provisioned IOPS, auto-growth **off**, high availability **off**,
     geo-redundant backup **off**. Tick a *free offer* box if one is shown.
   - Authentication: **MySQL authentication only**, admin `uniadmin` and a strong
     password. Avoid `@ # % & $`; they cause trouble in the shell.
3. **Networking:**
   - **Public access**
   - Tick **Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server**
     (this lets App Service connect)
   - Click **+ Add current client IP address** (this lets your Mac connect)
4. **Review + create.** Check the cost shows as free, then **Create**. It takes 5–15 minutes.
5. Check the settings from the terminal:
   ```bash
   az mysql flexible-server show -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-db \
     --query "{state:state, sku:sku.name, tier:sku.tier, storageGB:storage.storageSizeGb, ha:highAvailability.mode}" -o table
   ```
   This should show `Ready`, `Standard_B1ms`, `Burstable`, `20` and `Disabled`.
6. Create the database:
   ```bash
   mysql -h uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com -u uniadmin -p --ssl-mode=REQUIRED
   ```
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE uniexchange CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   SHOW DATABASES;
   EXIT;
   ```

If `mysql` hangs and times out, your internet IP has changed since the firewall
rule was made (mobile data, a different Wi-Fi). Go to **server → Networking → +
Add current client IP address → Save**.

### Part 2 — Create the App Service

1. Portal → **App Services** → **+ Create → Web App**.
2. **Basics:**
   - Resource group: `uniexchange-rg` (the existing one)
   - Name: `uniexchange-api`
   - Publish: **Code**
   - Runtime stack: **Java 25**
   - Java web server stack: **Java SE (Embedded Web Server)**. Not Tomcat or
     JBoss: the jar has its own server.
   - Operating system: **Linux**
   - Region: same as the database
   - Linux plan: **Create new** → `uniexchange-plan`; pricing plan **Free F1**.
     Click **Explore pricing plans** if only paid plans are shown.
3. **Database tab:** leave unticked. **Deployment:** continuous deployment
   **disabled**. **Monitoring:** Application Insights **No**.
4. **Review + create.** It must say **Free F1**. Then **Create**.
5. **Check the runtime was saved.** Ours came out empty the first time:
   ```bash
   az webapp config show -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api --query linuxFxVersion -o tsv
   # must print JAVA|25-java25. If it is empty:
   az webapp config set -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api --linux-fx-version "JAVA|25-java25"
   ```
6. Get the backend URL. With "secure unique default hostname" on, it contains a
   random part, so always copy it rather than guess it:
   ```bash
   az webapp show -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api --query defaultHostName -o tsv
   ```
   `BACKEND_URL` is `https://` + that, with no trailing slash.

To see which Java versions Azure offers: `az webapp list-runtimes --os-type linux -o tsv | grep -i java`.

### Part 3 — Deploy the frontend to Vercel

Whoever owns the GitHub repo does this. Vercel deploys from `JoshBlack25/UniExchange`.

1. https://vercel.com/signup → **Hobby** → **Continue with GitHub**.
2. **Add New… → Project** → **Import** `JoshBlack25/UniExchange`. If it is not
   listed, use **Adjust GitHub App Permissions** to give Vercel access.
3. **Root Directory: `Frontend`.** This is the most important setting. Framework
   preset: Vite. Leave the build settings alone; `Frontend/vercel.json` sets them.
4. **Environment variables** (no trailing slash, no spaces):

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | the `BACKEND_URL` from Part 2 |
   | `VITE_SITE_URL` | `https://<project-name>.vercel.app` |

5. **Deploy**, then copy the domain from **Domains**. That is `FRONTEND_URL`.
6. If the real domain differs from `VITE_SITE_URL`: go to **Settings →
   Environment Variables**, fix it, then **Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy**. Vite reads
   these at **build** time, so changes need a redeploy.

Check the build picked up the backend URL: the page's Content-Security-Policy
`connect-src` should name it.
```bash
curl -s https://uniexchange-rust.vercel.app/ | grep -o 'connect-src[^;]*'
```

After this, every merge to `main` on `JoshBlack25/UniExchange` redeploys the frontend automatically.

### Part 4 — Backend environment variables

App Service → **Settings → Environment variables → App settings**. Set these, then
click **Apply** in the panel **and** Apply at the bottom of the page, then
**Confirm**. Saving restarts the app.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | `prod` |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `80` (App Service sends Java SE traffic to port 80) |
| `WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT` | `600` (F1 is slow to start; the default timeout is 230 s) |
| `DB_HOST` | `uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com` |
| `DB_NAME` | `uniexchange` |
| `DB_USERNAME` | `uniadmin` (just the name, no `@server`) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | the MySQL admin **password**, not the username |
| `JWT_SECRET` | a new secret: `openssl rand -base64 48`. Never reuse the local one |
| `BACKEND_URL` | from Part 2 |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | from Part 3 |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | the same as `FRONTEND_URL` |
| `SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO` | `update`. **First deploy on an empty database only**; removed in Part 6 |
| `SPRING_MAIL_HOST` / `SPRING_MAIL_PORT` | `smtp.gmail.com` / `587` |
| `SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME` / `SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD` | the Gmail address and its 16-character App Password (see [Email / OTP Delivery](#email--otp-delivery)) |
| `SPRING_MAIL_PROPERTIES_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH` | `true` |
| `SPRING_MAIL_PROPERTIES_MAIL_SMTP_STARTTLS_ENABLE` | `true` |
| `APP_OTP_FROM` | the same Gmail address |
| `APP_PAYFAST_VALIDATESOURCEIP` | `false`. Read [the PayFast note](#payfast-on-azure-the-source-address-check) first |

Without `SPRING_MAIL_HOST`, sign-up codes only go to the log and nobody can
register. `DB_HOST`, `FRONTEND_URL` and `BACKEND_URL` have no defaults in the prod
profile, so if one is missing, startup fails on purpose. PayFast stays on the
sandbox (no real money) unless the "Going live" settings in
[Payments](#payments-payfast) are added.

**Setting them from the terminal instead.** This copies the mail settings from your
untracked `application-local.properties` and generates the JWT secret, so no secret
is typed or printed. Add `DB_PASSWORD` in the portal afterwards.

```bash
PROPS=Backend/src/main/resources/application-local.properties
prop() { grep -E "^[[:space:]]*$1[[:space:]]*=" "$PROPS" | tail -1 | sed -E 's/^[^=]*=[[:space:]]*//; s/[[:space:]]+$//'; }
FRONTEND=https://uniexchange-rust.vercel.app
BACKEND=https://$(az webapp show -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api --query defaultHostName -o tsv)

az webapp config appsettings set -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api -o none --settings \
  "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod" "SERVER_PORT=80" "WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT=600" \
  "DB_HOST=uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com" "DB_NAME=uniexchange" "DB_USERNAME=uniadmin" \
  "BACKEND_URL=$BACKEND" "FRONTEND_URL=$FRONTEND" "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=$FRONTEND" \
  "SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update" \
  "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
  "SPRING_MAIL_HOST=$(prop spring.mail.host)" "SPRING_MAIL_PORT=$(prop spring.mail.port)" \
  "SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME=$(prop spring.mail.username)" "SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD=$(prop spring.mail.password)" \
  "SPRING_MAIL_PROPERTIES_MAIL_SMTP_AUTH=true" "SPRING_MAIL_PROPERTIES_MAIL_SMTP_STARTTLS_ENABLE=true" \
  "APP_OTP_FROM=$(prop app.otp.from)" \
  "APP_PAYFAST_VALIDATESOURCEIP=false"
```

**Never** copy `app.payfast.tunnel-discovery-url` from `application-local.properties`
to Azure, and never reuse its `spring.datasource.password` or `app.jwt.secret`.

Check a password works without printing it:
```bash
MYSQL_PWD=$(az webapp config appsettings list -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api \
  --query "[?name=='DB_PASSWORD'].value | [0]" -o tsv) \
  mysql -h uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com -u uniadmin --ssl-mode=REQUIRED -e "SELECT 'login ok'"
```

Turn on logging once, so startup can be watched:
```bash
az webapp log config -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api \
  --application-logging filesystem --docker-container-logging filesystem --level information
```

### Part 5 — Build and deploy the backend

```bash
cd Backend
./mvnw -B clean package          # runs the H2 test suite; the jar is only built if they pass
az webapp deploy -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api \
  --src-path target/uniexchange-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --type jar --async true
```

Always use `--async true`. Without it, F1's deployment service (Kudu) answered
`502` and nothing was deployed. With it, the output ends in `Site started
successfully` and `"status": "RuntimeSuccessful"`.

Watch the startup:
```bash
az webapp log tail -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api
```
Look for `The following 1 profile is active: "prod"` and `Started UniExchangeApplication`.
If there is **no** `verification emails will be logged, not sent` warning, SMTP is
live. The log is also in the portal under **Monitoring → Log stream**.

### Part 6 — Seed reference data and lock the schema

1. Check Hibernate created the tables (29 at the time of writing), then load the
   5 campuses and 9 categories. Without them, the Create Listing dropdowns are empty:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   mysql -h uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com -u uniadmin -p --ssl-mode=REQUIRED uniexchange \
     -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='uniexchange';"
   mysql -h uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com -u uniadmin -p --ssl-mode=REQUIRED uniexchange \
     < src/main/resources/db/seed-reference-data.sql
   ```
   The `role` table starts empty. The STUDENT role is created when the first
   account registers.
2. **Remove** `SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO` so production runs with `validate` again:
   ```bash
   az webapp config appsettings delete -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api \
     --setting-names SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO
   ```
3. Check the log shows a fresh `Started UniExchangeApplication` with no
   `SchemaManagementException`. A schema mismatch stops startup at that point.
4. **Never** run the `seed` profile (`DevDataSeeder`) against production. It
   creates fake accounts whose password is `Password123!`.

Later deploys that add a table or column must create it in Azure **before** the
deploy, because `validate` will not. See
[Production profile and schema](#production-profile-and-schema).

### Part 7 — End-to-end check

Give the backend a minute to wake up first.

1. Open the frontend and sign up with `240453182@mycput.ac.za`. That account
   becomes ADMIN on verification (`app.bootstrap.admins`).
2. The 6-digit code arrives by email. **Check Junk.**
3. Create a listing with a photo. The dropdowns should be filled, and the photo
   should load over `https://`.
4. Refresh on `/feed` or `/wallet`. It should not 404.
5. Make a sandbox wallet top-up. The balance should update within a few seconds
   of returning from PayFast.

### Testing the live deployment

**Never point `./mvnw test` at the live database.** The tests are written for the
in-memory H2 database in `src/test/resources/application.properties`, and that
file sets `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`. Against Azure, Hibernate
would **drop every table, and all the data in them,** when the tests finish. The
tests also create and delete their own users, listings and wallets. Run them
locally before each deploy instead. Part 5's `./mvnw -B clean package` already does.

To test the live site, use checks that only read:

**1. API smoke test.** No login needed:
```bash
B=https://uniexchange-api-erbwhnbeg4fpdydv.southafricanorth-01.azurewebsites.net
curl -s $B/api/categories        # JSON with 9 categories
curl -s $B/api/campuses          # JSON with 5 campuses
curl -s $B/api/listings          # JSON array ([] when empty)
# CORS: must echo the Vercel origin back
curl -s -D - -o /dev/null -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: https://uniexchange-rust.vercel.app" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type" \
  $B/api/auth/login | grep -i access-control-allow-origin
```
If a call returns HTML titled **"Microsoft Azure App Service - Welcome"**, the jar
is **not** deployed. That page also comes back with HTTP 200, so do not trust the
status code alone.

**2. Read-only database checks:**
```bash
mysql -h uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com -u uniadmin -p --ssl-mode=REQUIRED uniexchange -e "
  SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user) users, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM listing) listings,
         (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM campus) campuses, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM category) categories;
  SELECT top_up_id, amount, status, created_at, completed_at
  FROM wallet_top_up ORDER BY top_up_id DESC LIMIT 5;"
```
Only run `SELECT`s against production.

**3. The Part 7 checklist in a browser**, after every deploy.

**4. The logs.** Every PayFast step and every startup problem is logged:
```bash
az webapp log tail -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api
# or download everything:
az webapp log download -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api --log-file logs.zip
```

To try a risky change against real MySQL, run the app locally against your own
MySQL (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)), never against Azure.

### PayFast on Azure: the source-address check

The first sandbox top-up on Azure was paid but never credited. The log showed:

```
PayFast ITN for <id> came from unexpected address 144.126.193.139
```

The signature check had passed. `144.126.193.139` **is** PayFast's: it is listed
under `w1w.payfast.co.za`. But `PayFastService.isFromPayFast` looks the PayFast
hostnames up in DNS when each ITN arrives, and on Azure the result did not
include it. The exact cause was not confirmed. So production currently runs with
`APP_PAYFAST_VALIDATESOURCEIP=false`.

That is acceptable on the **sandbox**, because the source check is defence in
depth only: the signature check and the confirmation call back to PayFast still
authenticate every ITN. **Before going live with real money:** change the check
so it does not depend on a live DNS lookup (for example, also accept PayFast's
published IP ranges from https://developers.payfast.co.za/docs, ITN section),
deploy that, then delete `APP_PAYFAST_VALIDATESOURCEIP`.

A top-up whose ITN was rejected stays `PENDING` for good. Start a new one.

### Redeploying

#### After editing the code

The frontend redeploys itself. **The backend does not**: someone has to build and
upload the jar. Always deploy what is on the team repo's `main`, so the live
frontend and backend come from the same code.

**1. Make and check the change on your own branch** (see [Git Workflow](#git-workflow)):
```bash
git checkout <your-branch>
# ...edit...
cd Backend && ./mvnw test && cd ..                    # backend tests (H2, never the live DB)
cd Frontend && npm run build && npm run lint && cd ..  # frontend build and lint
```

**2. Push your branch and open a pull request** into `main` on
`JoshBlack25/UniExchange`. Get it reviewed and merged.

**3. Frontend: nothing to do.** Vercel rebuilds and deploys on every merge to
`main`. Check the project's **Deployments** tab shows the new deployment as
**Ready**. If the build failed, the red lines in its build log say why, and the
previous version stays live.

**4. Backend: build and upload from the merged `main`:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main     # the team repo. If your "origin" IS the team repo: git pull origin main
cd Backend
./mvnw -B clean package    # stops here if a test fails, and nothing is deployed
az login                   # only if the CLI says your login has expired
az webapp deploy -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api \
  --src-path target/uniexchange-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --type jar --async true
```
Wait for `Site started successfully`. If it reports a `502` instead, run the same
command again.

**5. Check it.** Watch the log for `Started UniExchangeApplication`:
```bash
az webapp log tail -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api     # Ctrl+C to stop
```
Then run the API smoke test from
[Testing the live deployment](#testing-the-live-deployment) and click through the
part you changed on the live site.

**If the change adds an entity, a field or a table**, production's `validate`
refuses to start until the database has it. Do one of these **before** step 4:

- **A SQL script** (preferred). Write the `CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE ... ADD
  COLUMN`, commit it under `Backend/src/main/resources/db/`, and run it against Azure:
  ```bash
  mysql -h uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com -u uniadmin -p --ssl-mode=REQUIRED \
    uniexchange < Backend/src/main/resources/db/<your-script>.sql
  ```
- **Let Hibernate add it once.** Add the App Setting
  `SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update`, deploy, check the app started, then
  **delete the setting**. `update` only adds tables and columns. It never renames,
  changes or drops anything, so a renamed or retyped column still needs a script.

**If both frontend and backend changed** and the frontend calls a new endpoint,
deploy the backend (step 4) as soon as the PR is merged. Until then, the new
frontend is live against the old backend.

**Rolling back a bad deploy:**
- **Backend:** build and deploy the last good commit:
  ```bash
  git checkout <good-commit-sha>
  cd Backend && ./mvnw -B clean package
  az webapp deploy -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api \
    --src-path target/uniexchange-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --type jar --async true
  git checkout main
  ```
- **Frontend:** Vercel → **Deployments** → the last good one → **⋯ → Promote to Production**.

#### Other changes

| What changed | What to do |
|---|---|
| Backend or frontend code | [After editing the code](#after-editing-the-code), above |
| `VITE_*` variables | Change them in Vercel, then **Redeploy** |
| Backend settings | Portal → Environment variables, or `az webapp config appsettings set`. The app restarts by itself |
| Vercel domain | Update `FRONTEND_URL`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (Azure) and `VITE_SITE_URL` (Vercel, then redeploy) |
| Backend URL | Update `BACKEND_URL` (Azure) and `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (Vercel, then redeploy) |

### Pausing, checking the credit, and shutting down

**What uses the $100 credit.** With the settings in Parts 1 and 2, nothing should:

| Resource | Plan | Uses credit? |
|---|---|---|
| App Service `uniexchange-api` | F1 Free | No. Stopping it saves nothing |
| MySQL `uniexchange-db` | B1ms, 20 GB | No, for 12 months: Azure for Students includes 750 hours a month of B1ms and 32 GB of storage, and a month has at most 744 hours |
| Vercel | Hobby | No (not Azure) |

**Check the remaining credit** (billing data lags about 24–48 hours):
- https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance, signed in with the mycput account, or
- Portal → **Cost Management → Cost analysis**, scope **Azure for Students**. It should show $0.

**Pause.** The live site stops working while paused. The Vercel frontend stays
up but cannot reach the API.
```bash
az webapp stop -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api
az mysql flexible-server stop -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-db
```

**Resume.** Start the database first, then the app, and give it a minute:
```bash
az mysql flexible-server start -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-db
az webapp start -g uniexchange-rg -n uniexchange-api
```

- Azure **restarts a stopped MySQL server automatically after 30 days**. Stop it
  again if needed.
- While MySQL is stopped, compute is not billed, but storage is. 20 GB is inside
  the free 32 GB, so that is still $0. All data is kept.
- Pausing is only worth it after the free MySQL year ends. Until then it just
  takes the site offline.

**Shut down for good.** Do this when the project is finished, and before the free
MySQL year ends (12 months after the Azure account was created), because after
that B1ms bills the credit.

1. Back up the database if anything in it should be kept. Profile and listing
   photos are stored in the database, so they are included. Files under
   `/uploads` on the App Service are not.
   ```bash
   mysqldump -h uniexchange-db.mysql.database.azure.com -u uniadmin -p --ssl-mode=REQUIRED \
     --single-transaction --set-gtid-purged=OFF uniexchange > uniexchange-backup.sql
   ```
2. Delete everything Azure holds for the project. ⚠️ **Permanent**: the
   database, every account and listing, and the backend are gone, with no undo.
   ```bash
   az group delete -n uniexchange-rg
   ```
3. Remove or pause the Vercel project (Vercel → project → **Settings**), since it
   will have no backend to talk to.

### Deployment troubleshooting

These are the problems hit during the first deploy:

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `linuxFxVersion` is empty after creating the Web App | The runtime was not saved. `az webapp config set … --linux-fx-version "JAVA\|25-java25"` (Part 2) |
| `az webapp deploy` fails with `Kudu Status: 502` | F1's deployment service timed out. Rerun with `--async true` |
| API returns HTML "Microsoft Azure App Service - Welcome" | No jar deployed yet, even though the status is 200. Redeploy and check for `RuntimeSuccessful` |
| `Access denied for user 'uniadmin'` | `DB_PASSWORD` holds the wrong value (the username, for example). Test it with the `MYSQL_PWD=…` command in Part 4 |
| `mysql` from your Mac times out | Your IP changed. Add it under the database's **Networking** |
| Startup fails naming `DB_HOST`, `FRONTEND_URL` or `BACKEND_URL` | That setting is missing. The prod profile has no defaults for them, on purpose |
| Startup fails with `SchemaManagementException` | A table or column is missing. Create it, or add `SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update` once, start, then delete it |
| CORS error in the browser | `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` does not exactly match the Vercel URL (`https`, no trailing slash) |
| "Cannot reach the UniExchange server" | The backend is still waking up (wait a minute), or `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is wrong and needs a redeploy |
| No sign-up email | Check Junk. If the log says `verification emails will be logged, not sent`, `SPRING_MAIL_HOST` is missing |
| Wallet paid but not credited | Find `PayFast ITN …` in the log. The warning names the check that failed (see the PayFast note above) |
| The app stops responding until the next day | F1's 60 CPU-minutes per day are used up. Wait, or move to a paid plan, which uses the student credit |

## Email / OTP Delivery

By default **no email is sent**. With `spring.mail.host` unset, the app logs every message instead. This is deliberate: the whole signup flow can be run and tested with no SMTP credentials, so every team member can work on it and the test suite never mails anyone.

To send real email you need a Gmail address plus a **Google App Password** — a
16-character code that is *not* your Google login password.

**Getting the App Password**

1. Sign in to the personal Google account you want to send from. A
   `@mycput.ac.za` address will not work — it is a Microsoft mailbox, so Google
   cannot issue an App Password for it.
2. Turn on **2-Step Verification** at
   [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   App Passwords do not exist until 2FA is on; this is the step people get stuck on.
3. Go to [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords),
   name it `UniExchange`, and click **Create**.
4. Copy the 16-character code (four blocks of four). It is shown only once.

If that page says App Passwords are unavailable, it is one of: 2FA still off, a
Workspace/school account whose admin disabled them, or Advanced Protection on.

**Where to put it — the untracked file, never `application.properties`**

Add these to `Backend/src/main/resources/application-local.properties`. That file
is gitignored and loads automatically, so nothing secret is ever committed:

```properties
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=you@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
app.otp.from=you@gmail.com
```

Restart the backend. The `verification emails will be logged, not sent` warning
disappearing is how you know real SMTP is live. Comment out the `spring.mail.host`
line to go back to console logging. If the SMTP server is unreachable,
registration returns a clean `503` rather than failing silently.

Mail from Gmail into a university Microsoft tenant often lands in **Junk** — check there before assuming it failed.

> **Why an emailed code rather than "Sign in with Microsoft"?** Because the OTP is what actually proves the account is real: if `240453182@mycput.ac.za` isn't a genuine mailbox, the code never arrives, so the account can never be activated. Entra ID SSO would be a good addition later, but it needs an Azure app registration and CPUT's tenant admin can disable third-party consent at any time — so it can only ever be an extra door, not the only one. Note also that `mycput.ac.za` (students) and `cput.ac.za` (staff) are two separate Entra tenants.

## Payments (PayFast)

Students add money to their wallet through [PayFast](https://payfast.io). Out of
the box this runs against **PayFast's sandbox**: a real payment screen, but no real
money moves.

### How a top-up works

1. The student enters an amount on `/wallet` and clicks **Continue to PayFast**.
2. `POST /api/wallet/topup` records a `PENDING` row in `wallet_top_up` and returns
   a set of form fields, signed with an MD5 signature.
3. The browser posts those fields to `https://sandbox.payfast.co.za/eng/process`,
   and the student pays on PayFast's page.
4. PayFast's **servers** call our `notify_url` (`POST /api/payfast/itn`). This is
   the **ITN** (Instant Transaction Notification). It is the only thing that
   credits a wallet.
5. The backend checks the ITN: the signature, the source address, that the amount
   and merchant match, that the status is `COMPLETE`, and finally asks PayFast
   directly whether it really sent it. Only then does it mark the top-up
   `COMPLETED` and credit the wallet.
6. PayFast sends the student back to `/wallet?topup=done`, which polls until the
   new balance appears.

The student arriving back at `return_url` proves nothing, because anyone can
open that link. Money moves only on a validated ITN.

**Where the code lives** (`Backend/src/main/java/za/ac/cput/`)

| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `service/transactions/PayFastService.java` | Builds the signed form, validates the ITN, credits the wallet |
| `service/transactions/PayFastSignature.java` | The MD5 signature, PHP-compatible |
| `controller/transactions/MyWalletController.java` | `POST /api/wallet/topup` |
| `controller/transactions/PayFastController.java` | `POST /api/payfast/itn`, open to everyone (`permitAll`) because PayFast sends no JWT |
| `controller/transactions/PayFastSimulatorController.java` | Dev-only stand-in for PayFast, off by default |
| `Frontend/src/components/wallet/TopUpForm.tsx` | Builds and submits the form that goes to PayFast |

### Running the sandbox on your machine

The catch: in step 4, PayFast has to reach your backend **from the internet**, and
`localhost` isn't reachable from there. A free Cloudflare quick tunnel gives your
`localhost:8080` a public HTTPS address. No Cloudflare account is needed.

**1. Sandbox credentials.** The team's sandbox merchant is already in
`application.properties` (`10054859` / `dku03dr7i156u`, no passphrase), so you
don't need your own. If you want one, register at
[sandbox.payfast.co.za](https://sandbox.payfast.co.za) and put your merchant ID
and key in your `application-local.properties`:

```properties
app.payfast.merchant-id=<your sandbox merchant id>
app.payfast.merchant-key=<your sandbox merchant key>
# Only if you set a passphrase on the sandbox dashboard. It must match exactly.
app.payfast.passphrase=<your passphrase>
```

> PayFast's old shared demo merchant (`10000100` / `46f0cd694581a`), which older
> tutorials still quote, **no longer works**. Every payment fails with
> *"Generated signature does not match submitted signature"*.

**2. Install cloudflared** (once):

```bash
brew install cloudflared                       # macOS
winget install --id Cloudflare.cloudflared     # Windows
```

**3. Tell the backend about the tunnel** (once). Add these two lines to
`Backend/src/main/resources/application-local.properties`:

```properties
app.payfast.tunnel-discovery-url=http://127.0.0.1:20241/quicktunnel
app.payfast.validate-source-ip=false
```

- The first line lets the backend find the tunnel's public URL by itself (see
  the next section).
- The second is needed because, through a tunnel, the ITN arrives from
  cloudflared rather than from PayFast's own address, so the source check would
  always fail. The signature check and the confirmation call to PayFast still run.
- **Never** put either line in `application.properties`.

**4. Start everything.** In VS Code, open Run and Debug, choose **"Full Stack +
PayFast tunnel"**, and press F5. This starts the tunnel (the `payfast: tunnel`
task), then the backend and frontend. F5 remembers the profile you picked.

**5. Make a test top-up.**
1. Open `/wallet` and click **Continue to PayFast**.
2. You land on PayFast's sandbox checkout page. Finish the payment there; it's a
   test environment, so nothing is charged.
3. PayFast sends you back to your wallet.

**6. Check it worked.**
- The balance on `/wallet` updates within a few seconds.
- The backend Debug Console shows `PayFast ITN received …` followed by
  `Credited 100.00 to user …`.
- In MySQL, the top-up is `COMPLETED`:
  ```sql
  SELECT top_up_id, amount, status, created_at, completed_at
  FROM wallet_top_up ORDER BY top_up_id DESC LIMIT 5;
  ```
- The sandbox dashboard's **"All received ITNs"** list shows the delivery. There,
  "Success" only means our endpoint replied `200`, and it always does, even when it
  rejects an ITN. The database and the log are the real proof.

### Does the tunnel URL change?

**Yes, every time cloudflared starts** you get a new random
`https://<words>.trycloudflare.com`. You never copy it anywhere, though.
cloudflared reports its current address on a local status server
(`http://127.0.0.1:20241/quicktunnel`), and when `app.payfast.tunnel-discovery-url`
is set, `PayFastService` asks it on **every** top-up. A new URL is picked up on the
next top-up, with no config edit and no backend restart.

Things to know:

- A top-up started **before** the tunnel restarted is signed with the old URL, so
  its ITN never arrives and it stays `PENDING`. Start a new one.
- The tunnel keeps running after you stop debugging. The next F5 **reuses** it
  instead of starting a second one, so the URL stays the same between sessions.
  Use **"Tasks: Terminate Task" → payfast: tunnel** to stop it.
- Only one cloudflared can use port `20241`. A tunnel you started by hand with
  the same `--metrics 127.0.0.1:20241` flag is reused too. One started without
  that flag is not, so stop it.
- If the backend can't reach cloudflared, **it refuses to start the top-up**, and
  the wallet page shows *"The PayFast tunnel isn't running …"*. Without the tunnel
  PayFast could never confirm the payment, so you'd pay and the wallet would never
  move.
- Quick tunnels are for testing only. They have no uptime guarantee.

### No tunnel? Use the simulator

Set `app.payfast.simulator.enabled=true` in `application-local.properties` and
restart. The wallet page then completes top-ups itself, without contacting
PayFast, through `POST /api/dev/payfast/complete/{m_payment_id}`. That runs the
same crediting code a real ITN does.

It's for offline demos. It only lets a student complete **their own** pending
top-up, and `@Profile("!prod")` stops it from ever loading in production.

### Going live (real money)

**No code changes are needed.** Going live is settings only. Set these as
**Application settings** in Azure App Service (environment variables), never in a
committed file:

| Property | Sandbox (now) | Live | Azure env var |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app.payfast.sandbox` | `true` | `false` (switches to `www.payfast.co.za`) | `APP_PAYFAST_SANDBOX` |
| `app.payfast.merchant-id` | `10054859` | From your **live** PayFast dashboard | `APP_PAYFAST_MERCHANTID` |
| `app.payfast.merchant-key` | `dku03dr7i156u` | From your live dashboard | `APP_PAYFAST_MERCHANTKEY` |
| `app.payfast.passphrase` | empty | **Set one** on the live dashboard and copy it exactly | `APP_PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE` |
| `app.payfast.notify-url` | `localhost` | `https://<backend>.azurewebsites.net/api/payfast/itn` | `APP_PAYFAST_NOTIFYURL` |
| `app.payfast.return-url` | `localhost:5173/...` | `https://<frontend>/wallet?topup=done` | `APP_PAYFAST_RETURNURL` |
| `app.payfast.cancel-url` | `localhost:5173/...` | `https://<frontend>/wallet?topup=cancelled` | `APP_PAYFAST_CANCELURL` |
| `app.payfast.validate-source-ip` | `false` (tunnel) | **`true`** | `APP_PAYFAST_VALIDATESOURCEIP` |
| `app.payfast.tunnel-discovery-url` | set (tunnel) | **unset** | leave out |
| `app.payfast.simulator.enabled` | `false` | **`false`** | leave out |

The env var names follow Spring's rule: dots become `_`, dashes are dropped, and
everything is uppercase. Also add the live frontend's address to
`app.cors.allowed-origins`.

**Steps**

1. Open and activate a **live** PayFast merchant account. Sandbox credentials
   don't work on the live site, and live ones don't work on sandbox.
2. Set a passphrase on the live dashboard. It's optional for once-off payments,
   but it stops anyone who has seen a form from forging one.
3. Deploy with the table's **sandbox** values, except `notify-url`, which points
   at the deployed backend. Do a sandbox top-up against the real server. This
   proves PayFast can reach your ITN endpoint over HTTPS without a tunnel.
4. Switch to the live values and do one small real top-up, say R5. Check the log
   and `wallet_top_up` exactly as in step 6 above.
5. Keep an eye on `PayFast ITN …` warnings in the logs for the first few days.

> Behind Azure's proxy, `server.forward-headers-strategy=native` (prod profile) means the
> source-IP check reads `X-Forwarded-For`. That's defence in depth only. The
> checks that actually authenticate an ITN are the signature and the
> confirmation call back to PayFast, so never remove either.

### Troubleshooting PayFast

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| PayFast shows *"Generated signature does not match submitted signature"* | Wrong merchant ID/key or passphrase, most often the retired `10000100` demo merchant, or a passphrase set on the dashboard but not in `app.payfast.passphrase` (or the other way round). |
| "Continue to PayFast" spins and nothing happens | The request to PayFast was never sent. Check the browser console. `TopUpForm` builds the form outside React for exactly this reason; don't move it back into JSX. |
| Paid, but the balance stays R0 and the top-up stays `PENDING` | The ITN didn't arrive or was rejected. No `PayFast ITN received` in the log means PayFast couldn't reach you: is the tunnel running, and was the top-up started after it? A `PayFast ITN …` warning names the check that failed. |
| Wallet page says *"The PayFast tunnel isn't running …"* | cloudflared isn't running, or isn't on port 20241. Start **"Full Stack + PayFast tunnel"**, or run `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080 --metrics 127.0.0.1:20241` in a terminal. Check the **payfast: tunnel** tab in the Terminal panel for its output. |
| `404` on a new wallet endpoint | The backend is still the old build. Restart it. |

**Things in this code that are easy to break**

- **Signatures follow PHP's `urlencode`**, not Java's `URLEncoder`. They differ on
  `*`, so always use `PayFastSignature.phpUrlEncode`.
- **Empty fields:** the outgoing form **skips** them, but the ITN check
  **includes** them. PayFast's ITN is full of empty fields (`custom_str1=`, …).
  Mixing the two rules rejects every real payment without an error.
- **`@Transactional` on a method called through `this` does nothing.**
  `handleNotification` therefore opens its transaction with a
  `TransactionTemplate`. Without it, crediting fails with "no transaction".
- **Field order is part of the signature.** Keep the fields in a `LinkedHashMap`
  and don't reorder `beginTopUp`.

## Backend

The main class is `za.ac.cput.UniExchangeApplication`. It sits at the base package root, so component scan, entity scan and Spring Data repository scan all root at `za.ac.cput` — no `scanBasePackages`, `@EntityScan` or `@EnableJpaRepositories` needed.

### Package layout

| Package | Contents |
|---|---|
| `domain/<subdomain>` | 22 JPA entities + 13 enums |
| `repository/<subdomain>` | Spring Data JPA repositories |
| `factory/<subdomain>` | The **only** construction path for entities, validated via `Helper` |
| `service` + `service/<subdomain>` | `IService<T, ID>` plus an interface + impl per entity |
| `controller/<subdomain>` | REST controllers, `AuthController`, `GlobalExceptionHandler` |
| `dto/<subdomain>`, `dto/auth` | Request/response records |
| `security` | `JwtService`, `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `UniExchangeUserDetailsService` |
| `config` | `SecurityConfig`, `MailConfig` |
| `mail` | `EmailSender` plus SMTP and logging implementations |
| `validation` | The `@StudentEmail` constraint |
| `util` | `Helper` — all shared validation |

Sub-domains are consistent across every layer: `identity`, `marketplace`, `transactions`, `trust`, `communication`, `community`, `admin`.

Entities expose only a nested fluent `Builder` (with `copy()` and `build()`), a protected no-arg constructor for JPA, and getters — **no public setters**. Always construct through the matching factory.

### Domain model

| Package | Entities |
|---|---|
| `identity` | Campus, Role, User, UserRole, Verification |
| `marketplace` | Category, Listing, ListingImage |
| `communication` | Conversation, ConversationParticipant, Message, **ChatMedia**, Notification |
| `trust` | Review, Report, VendorApplication, TrustedSellerBadge |
| `transactions` | Transaction, Payment, Wallet, WalletTransaction, **WalletTopUp** |
| `community` | BulletinPost |
| `admin` | AuditLog |
| `enums` | 14 enums matching the MySQL `ENUM` columns |

Foreign keys are modelled as plain scalar `long` columns (`Listing.sellerId`, not `Listing.seller`) — there are no JPA relationship annotations anywhere.

### Authentication endpoints

Only verified CPUT students can obtain a token.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/auth/register` | Creates a `PENDING_VERIFICATION` account and emails a 6-digit code. **Returns 202 with no token.** |
| `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` | Exchanges a valid code for a JWT and sets the account `ACTIVE`. The only endpoint that issues a token, and the only one that trusts a device. |
| `POST /api/auth/resend-otp` | New code, subject to the cooldown. Always 202 for an unknown address, so registered student numbers cannot be enumerated. |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | Email + password, plus an optional `deviceToken` and `rememberMe`. **Two outcomes** — see below. Unverified accounts still get `403` with `code: "EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED"`. |
| `GET /api/auth/me` | The authenticated user (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). |

Codes are stored only as a BCrypt hash, expire in 10 minutes, and are capped at 5 attempts.

### "Remember me" — the emailed code is a second factor, not just an activation step

The password alone is never enough. Once it checks out, `/login` either recognises the
browser or emails a code:

| Outcome | Status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| trusted device | `200` | `AuthResponse` with a token |
| anything else | `202` | no token — a code was sent, finish at `/verify-otp` |

A browser earns that trust only by completing an OTP, and `rememberMe` decides how long
it keeps it:

- **Ticked** — 30 days, sliding forward on each use, and the session itself lasts 30 days.
  The client keeps both in `localStorage`, so a restart changes nothing.
- **Not ticked** — 12 hours at most, and the client keeps both in `sessionStorage`, so
  closing the browser loses them and the next sign-in needs a fresh code.

The device token is an opaque 256-bit value stored only as a SHA-256 hash (not BCrypt —
a salted hash cannot be looked up, and there is nothing to brute-force in 256 random
bits). It is bound to one account, so presenting another student's token does not skip
your code. **It never replaces the password** — it only ever skips the second factor.

Changing your mind is handled: ticking the box on a browser that was trusted for the
session only re-issues the token into `localStorage` and retires the old one, so the two
halves cannot drift apart.

> Because a wrong password is rejected before any of this, `/login` can never be used to
> send someone an unwanted email.

Every other entity has standard CRUD at `/api/<plural-name>` — e.g. `GET /api/listings`, `POST /api/campuses`. `GET` on listings, listing images, categories, campuses, bulletin posts, seller ratings and badges is public; everything else needs a token.

**`ADMIN` only:** audit logs, reports, and the generic CRUD for money, chat and
trust — `/api/wallets`, `/api/wallet-transactions`, `/api/payments`,
`/api/transactions`, `/api/conversations`, `/api/conversation-participants`,
`/api/messages`, `/api/trusted-seller-badges`. Those controllers take ids
straight from the request body with no ownership check, so while they were merely
"authenticated" any signed-in student could credit their own wallet, read
anyone's private messages or grant themselves a Trusted Seller badge. Real use
goes through the authorization-aware flow controllers instead — `/api/chat`,
`/api/wallet`, `/api/purchases` and `POST /api/reviews`. **Keep new endpoints out
of those ADMIN-only prefixes.**

### Messaging, wallet and trust

The three features that turn the marketplace into somewhere two students can
actually complete a deal. All of them resolve the acting student from the JWT -
**an id in the URL or body is never enough on its own**.

#### Chat — `/api/chat`

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/chat/threads` | The inbox: other participant, listing, last message and unread count, assembled server-side |
| `POST /api/chat/threads` | `{otherUserId, listingId?}` → find-or-create. Safe to call twice |
| `GET /api/chat/threads/{id}/messages?afterMessageId=` | The poll. Returns `[]` when nothing is new |
| `POST /api/chat/threads/{id}/messages` | `{content?, mediaId?}` — at least one required |
| `POST /api/chat/threads/{id}/media` | multipart upload → `{mediaId}`, sent with the next message |
| `POST /api/chat/threads/{id}/read` · `GET /api/chat/unread-count` | Read receipts and the nav badge |

**Delivery is polling, not WebSockets.** The app is deployed to Azure App Service,
where the cheaper tiers unload an idle app after ~20 minutes and drop every
persistent connection, and where scaling out would break an in-memory STOMP
broker. The `afterMessageId` cursor makes each poll cheap and is the same shape a
push implementation would use later.

**Attachments are private.** They are stored outside the public `/uploads/**`
tree and served by `GET /api/chat/media/{id}?u=&exp=&sig=`, which verifies an
HMAC bound to `(mediaId, viewerId, expiry)` *and* re-checks conversation
membership on every request. That endpoint is `permitAll` in `SecurityConfig` out
of necessity, not laxity: `<img>`, `<audio>` and `<video>` cannot send an
`Authorization` header, so a filter-chain rule would 401 every attachment on the
page.

Voice notes are recorded in the browser with `MediaRecorder`. Two things about
that are worth knowing before touching it: Safari records **MP4/AAC** and cannot
produce WebM, so the format is negotiated and read back from the recorder; and
the resulting container has **no duration**, so `audio.duration` is `Infinity`
and the UI draws its own progress bar from a `durationMs` measured while
recording.

#### Wallet and escrow — `/api/wallet`, `/api/purchases`

Buying debits the buyer immediately and holds the funds; the seller is paid only
when the buyer confirms receipt. **There is no `held_balance` column** — money in
escrow is simply a `Transaction` in `PENDING`, so the reconciliation identity is:

    sum(wallet.balance) + sum(PENDING transaction amounts) == sum(completed top-ups)

Because of that, `available` is already net of anything held. Show
"Available · In escrow · Total"; never subtract one from the other.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/wallet` · `GET /api/wallet/ledger` | Balance (+ escrow) and the full audit trail |
| `POST /api/wallet/topup` | Returns the signed PayFast form fields to POST |
| `POST /api/wallet/transfer` | Send money straight to another student, by student email |
| `POST /api/payfast/itn` | PayFast's callback. **`permitAll`** — it carries no JWT |
| `POST /api/purchases` | Buy a listing; money is held |
| `POST /api/purchases/{id}/confirm` | Buyer confirms receipt — this is what pays the seller |
| `POST /api/purchases/{id}/cancel` | Either party cancels; the buyer is refunded in full |

Unconfirmed escrows are auto-released after `app.escrow.auto-release-days` so a
forgetful buyer cannot freeze a seller's money forever.

Two things in the money path are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:

- **Every balance change goes through `WalletServiceImpl.applyMovement`**, which
  locks the row and then calls `entityManager.refresh(..., PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)`.
  The refresh is not belt-and-braces: Hibernate will not re-read an entity
  already in the persistence context, so without it you hold the lock and still
  compute from a stale balance. `WalletMoneySafetyTest` fails with 10 successful
  R80 debits against a R100 balance if you remove it.
- **Status changes are compare-and-set**, never read-then-write. The row count is
  the authority. This is what stops two "I received it" clicks paying a seller
  twice, and two buyers claiming the same listing.

Top-ups go through PayFast. Sandbox setup, the local tunnel, going live and
troubleshooting are all in [Payments (PayFast)](#payments-payfast).

**Sending money to another student** (`POST /api/wallet/transfer`,
`{ recipientEmail, amount }`) is handled by `TransferServiceImpl`:

- The sender is always the token holder, never a value from the request body.
- The debit and the credit happen in one transaction, in ascending-userId lock
  order, so two students sending to each other at once can't deadlock.
- If the sender can't cover it, nothing moves.
- Rejections come back as `409` with a `code`: `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`,
  `RECIPIENT_NOT_FOUND`, `RECIPIENT_UNAVAILABLE` or `CANNOT_SEND_TO_SELF`.
- Both people's Activity lists get a row: `Sent to …` / `Received from …`, with
  `reference_type = TRANSFER`.

#### Reviews and the Trusted Seller badge

A review may only be written by someone who completed a transaction with the
person being rated, and the request body carries **no reviewee** — it is derived
from the transaction, so there is nothing to forge.

The badge is earned at **5 completed sales to 5 different buyers**, each rated at
least 4, while the overall average stays at or above the floor (all three are
properties under `app.trust.badge.*`). Every clause closes a way of farming it:
distinct buyers stops one friend buying five times, the average floor stops five
good reviews outweighing twenty bad ones, and a unique constraint on
`(transaction_id, reviewer_id)` stops one buyer stacking five reviews on one
sale. It is revoked automatically if the average later falls through the floor.

> `ddl-auto=update` **silently skips** creating that unique constraint if the
> table already contains duplicates. Check with
> `SELECT transaction_id, reviewer_id, COUNT(*) FROM review GROUP BY 1,2 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`

### Error format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-09-04T21:08:18.648352",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Request validation failed",
  "fields": { "email": "Use your CPUT student email, for example 240453182@mycput.ac.za" }
}
```

`fields` appears on bean-validation failures; `code` appears on `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`.

## Frontend

See [`Frontend/README.md`](Frontend/README.md) for the full frontend guide.

```

Routes: `/` redirects by auth state · `/login` `/signup` `/verify` (public) ·
`/feed` `/listings/new` `/listings/:listingId` `/profile` `/profile/:userId`
`/notifications` `/messages` `/messages/:conversationId` `/bulletin` (protected) ·
anything else shows a 404 page.

Every signed-in route renders inside a shared `AppLayout` (top bar + mobile tab
bar), so no page writes its own header. Each page is owned by one team member and
each feature has its own API module — see
[`Frontend/README.md`](Frontend/README.md) for the ownership table.

The JWT and the trusted-device token are kept together, in `localStorage` when "Remember me" is ticked and in `sessionStorage` when it is not — which is exactly what makes an unticked sign-in end when the browser closes. There is no refresh endpoint, so an expired token is treated as signed out on load.

```bash
npm run dev       # dev server on :5173
npm run build     # type-check + production bundle into dist/
npm run lint
npx tsc -b        # type-check only
```

## Testing

### Backend — 140 tests, no MySQL or SMTP required

```bash
cd Backend
./mvnw test
```

Tests run against **H2 in-memory** using `src/test/resources/application.properties`, so they need neither a database server nor mail credentials.

> **Never run them against the live Azure database.** The test profile uses
> `ddl-auto=create-drop`, which drops every table when the tests finish. See
> [Testing the live deployment](#testing-the-live-deployment) for safe checks.

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| `UniExchangeApplicationTests` | Spring context loads — proves the whole bean graph wires |
| `FactoryTest` | Builds all 22 entities through their factories; asserts each rejects invalid input |
| `HelperTest` | Validation utilities, including the student-email rule |
| `OtpServiceTest` | OTP expiry, the attempt cap, single use, and that codes are hashed |
| `DeviceTrustServiceTest` | "Remember me": tokens are hashed and never logged, are bound to one account, honour expiry and revocation, and only remembered devices get a sliding window |

### Frontend

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run build && npm run lint
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `invalid target release: 25` | `JAVA_HOME` points at a JDK older than 25 — see [Prerequisites](#1-a-jdk-version-25-or-newer) |
| `zsh: permission denied: ./mvnw` | `chmod +x Backend/mvnw` |
| `Communications link failure` or `Cannot load driver class` at startup | MySQL isn't running, or the URL/credentials are wrong. Confirm the server with `pgrep -fl mysqld` |
| `command not found: mysql` | The client isn't on `PATH` — `export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"`. This says nothing about whether the server is running |
| `Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'` | `DB_PASSWORD` is unset or wrong — see [step 3](#3-configure-your-database-password) |
| `WeakKeyException` at startup | `app.jwt.secret` is under 32 bytes; set a longer `JWT_SECRET` |
| No verification email arrives | Expected by default — the code is printed in the backend terminal. For real mail see [Email / OTP Delivery](#email--otp-delivery), and check Junk |
| Signing in asks for a code every time | Working as designed on a browser that has not been trusted. Tick **Remember me**, or note that without it the trust is dropped when the browser closes. The code is in the backend terminal |
| Login returns 403 `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` | That account never completed the OTP step. The frontend redirects to `/verify` automatically |
| Frontend shows "Cannot reach the UniExchange server" | The backend isn't running, or `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is wrong |
| CORS error in the browser console | Your origin isn't in `app.cors.allowed-origins`. Only the `Authorization` and `Content-Type` request headers are allowed — adding any custom header breaks the preflight |
| `Cannot access central ... in offline mode` | You used `-o`. Run once with internet to cache dependencies |
| Port 8080 or 5173 already in use | `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--server.port=8081`, or `npm run dev -- --port 5174` (then add that origin to `app.cors.allowed-origins`) |

## Database

The schema is the **`uniexchange`** database (MySQL 8+, `utf8mb4`): 22 tables across identity, marketplace, communication, trust, transactions, community and admin, with foreign keys, indexes and CHECK constraints for business rules (rating 1–5, non-negative money, buyer ≠ seller). Hibernate generates the tables from the entities on startup via `ddl-auto=update`.

The schema was designed against MySQL 8, but 9.x works too — Hibernate 7
auto-detects the dialect from the live connection, which is why
`spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect` must be left unset.

> Entity timestamp columns are populated by the factories rather than by MySQL `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, which keeps persistence portable between MySQL and the H2 used in tests.

## Git Workflow

- `main` is the integration branch — **never commit to it directly**.
- Each team member works on their own branch, named `initials-studentNumber` (e.g. `JRA-230317693`).
- Completed work is merged into `main` via a **pull request** reviewed by a teammate.
- Before opening a PR, pull the latest `main` and merge it into your branch to avoid conflicts.
- Never commit secrets. `.env*` files and `application-local.properties` are gitignored — keep it that way.

## Roadmap

1. **Done** — full backend layering (`domain → repository → factory → service → controller`), Spring Security + JWT, and verified-student auth with email OTP.
2. **Done** — frontend signup, OTP verification and login (React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + react-router 7), plus the shared app shell and a routed, owner-assigned stub for every remaining page.
